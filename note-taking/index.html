    <p><p><strong>Nov 17, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Been using Roam for sometime now, but found a couple things really missing in Roam are - </p>
<ol>
<li>No two-factor authentication, so if anyone with your password has the key to the treasure.</li>
<li>No end-to-end encryption, so everythig is getting transmitted in clear text</li>
<li>No native apps for Mac and iOS. This is more or less a deal breaker.</li>
</ol>
<p>Obsidian, in comparison seems to be have a better data model in this sense, cause it allows you to store the files in markdown format locally on your computer, which is a lot better they insisted than having no 2FA and no end-to-end encryption, which apps like Day One, Dropbox, and iCloud provide. </p>
<p>Based on that, started looking at [[Obsidian]] pretty seriously yesterday. I had heard of it couple months back when I was debating if there were any cheaper alternatives to Roam. I also didn't like the fact back then (which MPY also reiterated) that it was a web only app, with no Mac version available. </p>
<p>Another thing that they said that bothers me long term is the fact that they raised $8MM in funding, which can mean that they could lose track, and really fuck this up.</p>
<p>So, started looking at [[Obsidian]] last night, and got the theme, and the hotkeys, and the favorites matched up to how I had it in Roam, and am typing this into this window in [[Obsidian]]. I actually like this so far. It's not too different from Roam. There are a few differences in how they handle the actual outline of the text. The first major one here is that Roam is strictly an outline format, with bullets. It does have its own version of custom commands, like highlighting, word count, pomodoro timer etc, but overall, it's an outline format, with really good support for nesting. </p>
<p>[[Obsidian]], on the other hand is really all markdown, since it stores files in its native markdown format. So, you have the flexibility to create sections, and format the text using markdown format. Since it has the simplicity of markdown, it could potentially also act as your writing app. </p>
<p>Speaking of which it seems like there are few different kinds of note taking apps (again credit to MPU) for talking about this in their [[Mac Power Users (MPU) Podcast]] - Research episode.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Note Taking apps</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Library style apps - like Evernote, Devonthink - you just use them as a reference library, and keep puttitng things into them, like scanned papers, receipts etc. </li>
<li>Writing apps - like Ulysses, Bear, iAWriter etc.</li>
<li>Though collection and connections - This is where Roam, and Obsidian fit in, because they allow you to make connections between thoughts with backlinks. </li>
</ol>
<p>The line numbers here are pretty cool. This means that I can actually use this for full writing as well, including scripts for videos, and drafts for blog posts, with the exception of including images. </p>
<p>I am really liking the switch to [[Obsidian]].</p><p>
