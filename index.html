        <p class="blog-post-meta">2021-03-03</p>
        <img src = https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/7236102/1606343263/1500x500 />
        <p><p>My wife gifted me six weeks of stand-up comedy classes for my 35th birthday.</p>
<p>While I loved watching stand-up, actually doing stand up comedy had never occurred to me. My wife tells me that she gifted me the classes because she saw something in me. Something which made her realize that I should try stand-up comedy as a hobby. I’m not convinced. I think it was her way of getting me off her back with my endless <em>“have you ever noticed”, “I don’t like…”</em>, and <em>“what’s the deal with”</em> observations. She would at least get six weeks of respite from those.</p>
<h2>The First Show</h2>
<p>After six weeks of writing, performing, and preparing I was ready for my graduation show at NYC’s Gotham comedy club. I frequented this club as a member of the audience. But this time was different. I would be on stage. </p>
<p>I invited a few of my closest friends. I was super nervous when the host called out my name. <em>"Please welcome - Amit Jotwani!”.</em> My adrenaline was rushing. Before I knew it I was on stage, holding the mic, with fifty people looking at me. </p>
<p>I launched into my set with a cringeworthy one liner - <em>“Keep drinking. The more you drink, the funnier I get”.</em> I got a few giggles which was all I needed to release my nervous energy. </p>
<p>I finished my five minute set. It went well. I got some laughs. I didn’t bomb completely. I wasn’t a deer caught in the headlights. I liked it. I liked the laughs. I liked the claps and the adulation. Afterwards, a couple strangers even congratulated me on the performance.</p>
<h2>Operating in Safe Mode</h2>
<p>Encouraged by the relative success of my first outing I signed up for a few more slots at Gotham comedy club and Metropolitan Comedy Club. I also did a few open mics.</p>
<p>I loved getting on stage and adored the compliments. I knew my set well. I knew my lines. I knew my pauses. I knew what jokes were working and I stuck with those. I knew what to expect. </p>
<p>Writing new material and trying it out at open mics felt like a risky proposition. What if I failed? What if no one found it funny? What if I forgot my lines? What if I got heckled? </p>
<p>Worst of all, what if they found out that I was an imposter? That I was just a beginner, that the first set I wrote was a fluke? That I didn’t belong there on stage?</p>
<p>That seemed too risky. I knew what was working. I decided to operate in “Safe Mode”. </p>
<h2>Two sides of the tape</h2>
<p>Stand-up comedy is a two act process. There's the act of performing on stage and there’s the act of writing. </p>
<p>The first part is done in public. That's what people come to see. It’s the glamorous part. It’s what people cheer you on for. It’s what people remember you for. It’s also the relatively easy part. </p>
<p>The second part is behind the scenes - the act of writing. It’s the lonely part. It's not glamorous at all. No one sees this. No one’s cheering you on as you approach the writing desk every day. There’s no applause when you wrap up a writing session. There’s no immediate gratification. </p>
<p>It’s painful. It’s an arduous journey to create something from nothing. You have a funny premise but then you need to craft it so other people see what you see. Every word matters. You write and you rewrite. Rinse and repeat. It is brutal. It is painful.</p>
<p>But it's what you must do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most difficult thing in the world is to write. People tell you to write like you're supposed to be able to do it. Nobody can do it. It's impossible. The greatest people in the world can't do it. So if you're gonna do that, you should first be told what you are attempting to do is incredibly difficult.” ~ Jerry Seinfeld</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Don’t skip Side-B of the tape</h2>
<p>Like an old audio tape, the act of doing stand-up comedy is a combination of <em>side-A</em> and <em>side-B</em>. You don’t get the glamorous part of performing on stage (<em>side-A</em>) without also embracing the painful unglamorous part of writing (<em>side-B</em>). </p>
<p>We see Usain Bolt on the track winning the 100 meter race. We see the dramatic finish. We see the hero. We see him celebrate. We celebrate with him. That's the glamorous part. That’s <em>side-A</em>.</p>
<p>We see him getting the endorsements, the admiration, the fan following. All the perks of being famous and successful. Still <em>side-A</em>.</p>
<p>But what we don't see is the behind the scenes - <em>side-B</em> of the tape. The iceberg under the water. The brutal, arduous, unglamorous part of just showing up everyday to work on the craft. That’s what powers the glamorous <em>side-A</em> of the tape.</p>
<p>This series of A/B switches of getting in the arena, learning from the performance, and getting back to work on the craft is hard. It’s also something you must do to grow. You don’t get <em>side-A</em>, without <em>side-B</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, the 80:20 rule dictates that to succeed you would end up spending more time on <em>side-B</em> than <em>side-A</em>. </p>
<p>With stand-up comedy, this looks something like - </p>
<p><em>Side-B:</em> You write something you think is funny</p>
<p><em>Side-A:</em> Get on the stage to try it out</p>
<p><em>Side-B:</em> Get back to the writing table. </p>
<p>Repeat.</p>
<h2>Am I still doing stand-up comedy?</h2>
<p>So when people ask me, “Are you still doing stand-up comedy?” what they're really asking is “Are you still performing on stage?” (Side A)</p>
<p>The answer to that is “No”. </p>
<p>The question that’s more important to me, however is “Am I working on Side B?” Am I toiling on the craft? Am I putting in the reps? Am I showing up everyday to write?</p>
<p>Sadly, the answer to that is also a “No”.</p>
<h2>The Alibi</h2>
<p>While COVID can take some of the blame for me not being on stage, the other reason I haven’t been on stage as much is that I have been wanting to write new material. I don’t want to repeat the same stuff. This has been a double-edged sword because I am not writing any new material either. Why? Two reasons -</p>
<p><strong>Imposter Syndrome</strong> - “What if people find out that I’m a fluke? What if people criticize me? Why would people want to come and see me? Am I even funny?”</p>
<p><strong>Perfection Fugazi, and the fear of failure</strong> - “It’s not good enough. The ending sucks. The beginning sucks. It's not perfect yet.”</p>
<p>Perfection is the enemy of good. It's an illusion. It doesn't exist. To paraphrase Mark Hanna from “The Wolf of Wall Street” - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(Perfection) is a Fugayzi. It’s a fake. It's a whazy. It's a woozie. It's fairy dust. It doesn't exist. It's never landed. It is no matter. It's not on the elemental chart. It's not fucking real.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Note to Self: Focus on the reps - journey before destination</h2>
<p>Don't look for perfection. Focus on just showing up. Put in the reps. Instead of focusing on getting better, focus on "sucking less." That is liberating. If I suck a little less than last week that's progress. I’ll be putting my journey before the destination. </p>
<h2>Hold yourself accountable. Build in public. Share the ugly stuff.</h2>
<p>So in 2021 I've decided to liberate myself of the pressure of focusing on the destination of getting on stage and not failing. Instead I will focus my energy on just showing up and writing every day for an hour and publishing a new joke every week. </p>
<p>If you're reading this, please hold me accountable. Please remind me that it doesn’t matter if it's funny or not. Please remind me that it doesn’t matter if it sucks. Please remind me that I don't need to be this serious in life. I only need to be sincere at what I do. I only need to put in the reps.</p>
<p>And most important of all, that I have fun doing it. </p>
<p>Hopefully you will see me at an open mic in NYC soon (vaccines couldn’t come sooner)!</p><p>

        <a href="2020-09-12-three-things-i-enjoyed-this-week"><h2 class="blog-post-title">Three things I enjoyed this week</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2020-09-12</p>
        <img src = https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556917452-890eed890648?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1350&amp;q=80 />
        <p><p>So, I'm trying something new. Each week I'll try to write down three things that I enjoyed that week. Here’s the first edition for Week 37 (Sep 6-12, 2020).</p>
<h2>The Morning Brew</h2>
<p>I signed up for an email newsletter last week as an experiment. It’s called - <a href="morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=08cee7ad">The Morning Brew</a>. They send you an email every morning covering the news on a variety of interesting topics. What I like about it is that there's no political news, no negative news. It’s very informative, and very engaging. It’s got a fun personality to it. It's really well done.</p>
<p>I don’t usually look forward to newsletters, or even make it a habit of reading them, but I have actually been looking forward to “The Morning Brew" every morning. I scroll through the entire email while sipping on the morning coffee - perhaps exactly how they intended it? Highly <a href="morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=08cee7ad">recommend signing up</a>, and giving it a try.</p>
<h2>Protein Shake</h2>
<p>Tried a new protein shake recipe last week - <strong>The Creamcicle</strong>, and it came out really well. I typically do a mix of almond milk, bananas, and strawberries, along with the protein powder, but decided to switch strawberries with fresh orange juice, and it came out so delicious. I think I may have cracked an all time favorite recipe for me. </p>
<ul>
<li>1 scoop Vanilla Protein Powder</li>
<li>1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
<li>1/2 cup water</li>
<li>3 ounces frozen orange juice concentrate</li>
<li>1/2 frozen banana</li>
<li>1 tsp honey</li>
<li>3-5 ice cubes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Paul Graham's Essay - How to make wealth</h2>
<p>This is a long essay, covering a bunch of related topics, but one thing that caught my attention was the argument that “Money is not the same as Wealth". You can have wealth without having money. It’s an important distinction that we often forget. Money is a “medium of exchange”, something we use as a mechanism to trade what we have with what we need. Wealth, on the other hand is the fundamental thing. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wealth is stuff we want: food, clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on. You can have wealth without having money. If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn’t need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn’t matter how much money you had.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wealth is creating or making something that can then be either sold or even donated (think vaccines, like the penicillin). The point here is that wealth is about creating value in the world by making something that didn’t exist. </p>
<p>The second point I really liked is the argument - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to suggest that programmers are the ultimate craftsmen, because like craftsmen (who btw are now dwindling by the day) are the rare breed that can create something out of nothing, and create value for the company, or the community. That was pretty fascinating to me, and served as a reminder to me that as programmers, we have that power and privilege, which we must use with great responsibility, to create wealth.</p><p>

        <a href="2020-05-22-my-first-ios-app-using-swiftui"><h2 class="blog-post-title">My first iOS app using SwiftUI</h2></a>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">2020-05-22</p>
        <img src = https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591453090456-4c83e868cf46?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1350&amp;q=80 />
        <p><p>It took me some time. Fine, it took me a few years, but I finally got around to creating my first iOS app, using SwiftUI.</p>
<p>Created a simple single screen app that displays a random quote on the click of a button. A different quote each time you click that button. That’s it. </p>
<p>I’ve been reading <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesClear" title="James Clear">James Clear</a>’s fantastic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5AX61W/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" title="Atomic Habits">Atomic Habits</a> last couple weeks, and loving it. I figured I would add some gems from the book, so each time you hit that button, you get a fresh dose of Atomic Habits.</p>

</div>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>If you’ve never created an iOS app, I leave you with the basic steps, and the code that you can copy/paste. Thanks to SwiftUI, simply pasting this code will generate the view and the functionality for you. </p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Xcode</strong>, and create a new project . File -&gt; New -&gt; Project</li>
<li>Choose Single View App -&gt; Next</li>
<li>Give it a Name, for example - <strong>MyQuotesApp</strong></li>
<li>Leave the <strong>Language</strong> set to the default of <strong>Swift</strong></li>
<li>Leave the <strong>User Interface</strong> set to the default of SwiftUI</li>
<li>Uncheck the boxes for Core Data, Unit Tests, and UI Tests</li>
<li>Select the file <strong>ContentView.swift</strong> in the project navigator on the left.</li>
<li>Paste the code below inside this file.</li>
<li><code class="kb-btn">cmd</code>+<code class="kb-btn">s</code> to save the file</li>
<li><code class="kb-btn">cmd</code>+<code class="kb-btn">r</code> to run the code</li>
<li>That should open the simulator and display the app</li>
</ol>
<h2>Source Code</h2>
<pre><code class="language-swift">// Inside  ContentView.swift

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    //define the variable quoteText as @State, so we can track any changes to it, and update our display accordingly
    @State var quoteText = "Quote goes here"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(quoteText) //Text object to hold the quote
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                .padding(.vertical, 100.0)

            Button(action: {
                //generate random number
                let index = Int.random(in: 0..&lt;quotes.count)

                //pull a quote from the array using a random index number
                let quote = "\(quotes[index])"

                //update the state for the varaible quoteText
                self.quoteText = quote

                print(quote) //prints to the console
            }) {
                Text("Give me a quote")
            }
        }
    }
}
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}

let quotes = [
"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.",
"You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.",
"Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.",
"Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.",
"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement",
"If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.",
"Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.",
"When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different.",
"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.",
"Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations."
]

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2020-05-14</p>
        <img src = https://robocrop.realpython.net/?url=https%3A//files.realpython.com/media/Creating-A-Location-Based-Web-Application-with-Django-GeoDjango-and-Postgis_Watermarked.2cb08acd38d4.jpg&amp;w=960&amp;sig=81e0373cc635b2f9afe7641da5c0db5469c94e14 />
        <p><p>Been meaning to write this post for my future self, who’s invariably going to forget the steps to set up Django on a new machine. So, here are the steps to set up Django on a Mac. </p>
<p><em>Django what?</em> Django is a fully featured Python web framework that can be used to build complex web applications. </p>
<h2>Installing Python 3</h2>
<p>The first thing obviously is to make sure you have Python installed. Python 3 is the latest, so we will go with that by using Homebrew (if you don't have that installed, follow the instructions <a href="https://brew.sh/" title="here">here</a>)</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ brew install python3</code></pre>

<p>Note that since macOS ships with Python 2 already installed, after you install Python 3, you will now have both versions available.</p>
<p>To run Python 2, use the <code>python</code> command in the Terminal. For Python 3, use <code>python3</code> instead.</p>
<p>We can test the installation by typing in the Terminal:</p>
<pre><code>python3 —version
Python 3.7.7
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I ran into an issue where I simply could not get python3 to run. Executing both <code>python</code> and <code>python3</code> would just run Python 2.7. Turned out, it was a symlink error, and running the following command, AND removing any redundant python PATH from the ~/.bash_profile fixed it. </p>
<pre><code>brew link —overwrite python3
</code></pre>
<p>See [python 1="Mac" 2="Python3" 3="Not" 4="Working," 5="any" 6="idea?" 7="-" 8="Stack" 9="Overflow" language="-"]<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53670991/1195247">/python</a>, and <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1389295/python-points-to-python-2-7-under-macos-homebrew">“python” points to Python 2.7 under macOS Homebrew - Super User</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Setting up Python Virtual Environment</h2>
<p>Now that we have Python 3 installed, we are ready to setup Virtualenv.</p>
<h3>Installing Virtualenv</h3>
<p>We will use <code>pip</code>, a command line tool that lets you manage and install Python packages, to install <em>virtualenv</em>.</p>
<p>Note that when you used Homebrew to install Python 3, it also installed <em>pip</em> for you under the name pip3. So pip3 is already available for you.</p>
<p>In the Terminal, execute the command below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ sudo pip3 install virtualenv</code></pre>

<h3>Create a new virtual environment</h3>
<p>Create a new <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/virtual-environments-virtualenvs-venvs.html">virtual environment</a> with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ virtualenv &lt;environment_name&gt; -p python3</code></pre>

<p>Our virtual environment is created. Now before we start using it, we need to activate:</p>
<h3>Activating a virtual environment</h3>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ source venv/bin/activate</code></pre>

<p>You will know it worked if you see <em>(venv)</em> in front of the command line, like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/images/1_venv_activate.png" /> </p>
<h2>Installing Django</h2>
<p>We are now ready to install Django.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install Django==3.0.5
</code></pre>
<h2>Verifying Django Install</h2>
<p>To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type <em>python</em> from your shell. Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ python
>&gt;&gt; import django
>&gt;&gt; print(django.get_version())
3.0.5</code></pre>

<p><img alt="" src="/static/images/2_verify_django.png" /> </p>
<h2>Starting a New Project</h2>
<p>To start a new Django project, run the command below: </p>
<pre><code>$ django-admin startproject mysite
</code></pre>
<p>The command-line utility <em>django-admin</em> is automatically installed with Django.</p>
<p>This will create a <em>mysite</em> directory in your current directory.</p>
<h2>Running the web server</h2>
<p>Django comes with a simple web server installed. It’s very convenient during the development, so we don’t have to install anything else to run the project locally. We can test it by executing the command:</p>
<pre><code>$ python manage.py runserver
</code></pre>
<p>You may receive some migration errors. For now, you can ignore the migration errors.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/images/3_run_web_server.png" /> </p>
<h2>Serve the website</h2>
<p>Now open the following URL in a Web browser: <em><a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a></em> and you should see the following page:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/static/images/4_serve_django.png" /> </p>
<p>Congratulations on your first Django-powered page!</p>
<p>Hit Control + C to stop the development server.</p>

        <p><p>As a developer, I spend a large amount of my time writing code everyday. The rest, of course is spent debugging that code and “Googling” the internet for answers. But, I digress. All to say, that I am always looking for ways to speed up the development workflows when it comes to “getting started” with something, and then making it easy to “run”, and “deploy” the code. </p>
<p>One area I spend a significant amount of time every week is creating new Alexa Skills from scratch from a learning and education point of view. This is where I’ve found the ASK CLI to be super helpful in speeding up the workflow to create and update Alexa Skills, using the Alexa Skill Kit CLI tool. </p>
<h3>What is Alexa Skills Kit CLI?</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html">Alexa Skills Kit Command Line Interface</a>(ASK CLI) provides a quick way to perform a lot of Alexa skills tasks from the command line interface, like creating new skills, and deploying the code to Alexa Hosted or AWS. You can even simulate your skill from the command line. </p>
<h3>Using Templates with ASK CLI to jump start development of a new Alexa Skill</h3>
<p>One feature that I like the most about ASK CLI is that it allows you to create a new skill by using your own custom skill templates. So, if you’re like me, you can create a starter template for all your Alexa Skill projects. For example, if there are certain helper functions you use in every skill, it would make sense to include those in the template, so they’re available in the new skill right off the bat. </p>
<h3>Creating a new skill using a custom template</h3>
<p>To create a new skill using a custom template, you provide the Git URL of the template with the flag <code>--template-url</code>:</p>
<p>The command to create a new skill using a custom template varies a bit based on the version of the ASK CLI. To check the version of ASK CLI, simply type <code>ask -v</code> or <code>ask -V</code> in the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re using ASK CLI v2</strong><br />
If you’re using ASK CLI v2, you can create a new skill using a custom template using the command below - </p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">$ ask new --template-url https://example.com/example/example-skill.git --template-branch master</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Here’s a CLI v2 compatible I use to jump start my Python based Alexa Skills -<br />
<code>https://github.com/ajot/python-alexa-skill-starter-template-cli-v2.git</code>. If you like, you can use this to create a new skill by using the command below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ask new --template-url https://github.com/ajot/python-alexa-skill-starter-template-cli-v2.git --template-branch master</code></pre>

<p>You may get a warning, like the one below. Type "y" to continue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Warn]: CLI is about to download the skill template from unofficial template. Please make sure you understand the source code to best protect yourself from malicious usage."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/1qygrskh2p42amgawt8k.gif" /> </p>
<p>This will create the skill locally on your machine. You’re now ready to deploy the skill. See “Deploy” section below.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>If you’re using ASK CLI v1</strong><br />
If you’re using ASK CLI v1, you can create a new skill using a custom template using the command below - </p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ask new --template-url https://example.com/example/example-skill.git</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Here’s a CLI v1 compatible template I use to jump start my Python based Alexa Skills -<br />
<code>https://github.com/ajot/python-skill-basic-template.git</code>. If you like, you can use this to create a new skill by using the command below, and optionally, providing a skill name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ask new --template-url https://github.com/ajot/python-skill-basic-template.git -n &lt;optional-name-for-your-skill&gt; -n &lt;optional-skill-name&gt;</code></pre>

<p>You may get a warning, like the one below. Type "yes"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Downloading skill template from unofficial resource. Please make sure you understand what each script is doing to best protect yourself from malicious usage".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will create the skill locally on your machine.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Deploying the code to Alexa Developer Console, and AWS Lambda</h3>
<p>At this point, we need to locally install any other modules your skill may need. In the case of the Python template I mentioned above, it needs <code>ask-sdk-core</code> package to be installed. </p>
<p>As is generally a good practice, we first need to create/activate a <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/virtual-environments-virtualenvs-venvs.html">virtual environment</a>. There are several options available for managing virtual environments for Python. I personally use <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>, but you can tailor the steps below to match your virtual environment of choice (like <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/">Conda</a>). </p>
<p><strong>Create a new virtual environment</strong><br />
Create a new virtual environment<a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/virtual-environments-virtualenvs-venvs.html"></a> with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ virtualenv skill_env -p python3</code></pre>

<p>Our virtual environment is created. Now before we start using it, we need to activate:</p>
<p><strong>Activating a virtual environment</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ source skill_env/bin/activate</code></pre>

<p>You will know it worked if you see <em>(skill_env)</em> in front of the command line, like this:<br />
[Image: Screen Shot 2020-05-07 at 8.01.34 PM.png]<strong>Install any modules your skill may need</strong><br />
This specific template, for example needs the <code>ask-sdk-core</code> module. So let’s install that inside the virtual environment we created using the Python's pip command -</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ pip install ask-sdk-core</code></pre>

<p>We are now ready to deploy our skill to the developer console, and AWS lambda -</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ ask deploy</code></pre>

<h3>Verify and test the skill deployment</h3>
<p><strong>1. Verify the skill deployment on the Alexa Developer Console</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/7t0b69kdndlj0cos4ulx.png" /> </p>
<p><strong>2. Verify the code deployment on AWS Lambda Console</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ieimpx9f14zquxy92wwg.png" /> </p>
<p><strong>3. Test the skill in the Alexa Developer Console</strong></p>
<p>You can now test your skill using the "Test" tab inside the Alexa Developer Console at <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask/test">https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask/test</a></p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/0b6a5x5yczdpuxpxu8ik.png" /> </p>

        <p class="blog-post-meta">2020-04-17</p>
        <img src = https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/img16/grocery/desktopbbgettingstarted.jpeg />
        <p><p>As a developer, every day we interact with remote APIs and web servers. Almost all services we consume on the internet today are available in the form of an API: weather forecasts, geolocation services, Twitter feeds, and so on. </p>
<p>It’s only fair to imagine, that you may run into situations in which you would want an Alexa Skill to get meaningful data from one of these remote sources by making HTTP requests to their APIs. HTTP requests allow you to fetch data from a remote source. It could be an API, a website, or something else.</p>
<p>In this post, we will take a quick look how you can get external data from an external API from an Alexa Skill using Python 3.</p>
<p>While there are many libraries to make an HTTP request in Python, including <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html">http.client</a> (formerly named <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html">httplib</a> ), <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html">urllib</a> , <a href="https://github.com/httplib2/httplib2">httplib2</a> , <a href="https://github.com/twisted/treq">treq</a> , etc., the <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Requests</a> library is among the most popular Python libraries for making HTTP requests. The subtitle of “<em>HTTP for Humans</em>” perfectly captures the philosophy behind it. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple interface, and makes HTTP requests easy and simple.</p>
<p>If you’re using <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/hosted-skills/build-a-skill-end-to-end-using-an-alexa-hosted-skill.html">Alexa Hosted</a> as the backend for your skills, there’s an added advantage of the Requests library being built-in, so you don’t need to install or upload it manually. If you’re using AWS Lambda or any other service as the backend, you may need to install the <code>requests</code> module locally, and then upload it to the service.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, let’s jump into how you can use the Requests library to make an HTTP request to an API. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will be using the <a href="https://api.chucknorris.io/">Chuck Norris API</a>. You can obviously replace that with other APIs of your choice. </p>
<h2>Using Requests library to make an API call from an Alexa Skill</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the <code>requests</code> package by adding an import statement to the top of lambda_function.py:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import requests</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create a helper function to make the call to the API using the endpoint </p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def getResponseFromAPI():
    url = &#039;https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random&#039;
    response = requests.get(url)
    print(response.status_code) 

    json_data = response.json()
    joke = json_data[&#039;value&#039;]
    return joke
</code></pre>

<p>Here’s a sample of what the data that would get returned by the Chuck Norris API, and would be stored in the variable </p>
<p><img alt="Alt Text" src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/k941r6nh8dnuv1w310lc.png" /> </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Call the helper function from inside the LaunchRequestHandler (or any other intent handler that may be appropriate).</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class LaunchRequestHandler(AbstractRequestHandler):
    """Handler for Skill Launch."""

    def can_handle(self, handler_input):
        # type: (HandlerInput) -&gt; bool

        return ask_utils.is_request_type("LaunchRequest")(handler_input) or ask_utils.is_intent_name("AMAZON.YesIntent")(handler_input)

    def handle(self, handler_input):
        # type: (HandlerInput) -&gt; Response
        logging.info("LaunchRequest was trigerred")

        joke = getResponseFromAPI()
        return (
            handler_input.response_builder
            .speak(f"{joke}. Would you like to hear another Chuck Norris joke?")
            .ask("Would you like to hear another joke?")
            .response
        )</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully that makes it easy to make API requests from your Alexa Skills. If you're looking to learn more about building Alexa Skills, I’ll leave you with some resources if you’re looking to learn more about Alexa Skills, and the Python requests library in general. </p>

        <img src = https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/DeveloperBlogs/AlexaBlogs/default/AHS(2).png />
        <p><p>If you’re into building skills, you’re probably familiar with Alexa Skills Kit’s Command Line Interface, which lets you create and manage your skill using the CLI, like updating the interaction model, and the backend code. You can of course manage these directly through the Alexa Developer Console, and AWS respectively, but CLI is a much faster workflow.</p>
<p>There are two ways to create a new Alexa skill using the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html">ASK-CLI</a>. You can use AWS Lambda as your backend, or if you are new and would like to keep things simple initially, you can use Alexa Hosted.</p>
<p>With an Alexa-hosted skill, your code is available inside a code editor in the Alexa developer console itself, so you can edit and deploy changes to your code quickly, without needing to set up an AWS account. </p>
<p>Let’s look at how you can use the ASK-CLI to create a new skill using each of these two backend options. </p>
<h2>Option 1: Using AWS Lambda as the backend</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://developer.amazon.com/">An Amazon developer account</a>. Sign up is free.</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html#set-up-iam-user">Set up an AWS IAM user</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html#install-initialize">Install and initialize ASK CLI</a>  </li>
</ol>
<p>You can find more information about the prerequisites on the Amazon Developer Documentation <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a new skill using the ASK-CLI with AWS Lambda as backend</h3>
<ol>
<li>Assuming you already have the ask-cli setup (see prerequisites) , open up the terminal, and type the following -  </li>
</ol>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ ask new 
</code></pre>

<p>This will provide the following prompts - </p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Select the runtime - <code>Node.js V8</code> or <code>Python3</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose <code>hello world</code> as the template to get started with
  </li>
  <li>
    Type in your skill name - <code>ice-cream-soda</code> (or a name you prefer)<br />
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This will create the skill locally on your machine. </p>
<h3>Step 2: Deploying the skill (Interaction Model and AWS Lambda)</h3>
<p>Type the following into the command line - </p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ cd ice-cream-soda
$ ask deploy
</code></pre>

<p>This may take a few minutes, and if everything goes well, you will get a confirmation that <code>Your skill is now deployed and enabled in the development stage. Try simulate your Alexa skill skill using "ask dialog" command.</code> You can verify by logging into the Alexa developer console at <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask">developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask</a>. Your backend code has been deployed as an AWS Lambda function using the AWS IAM user you set up in #2 of the prerequisites, which you can verify by logging into your AWS Console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/">console.aws.amazon.com/lambda</a>.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Pushing the skill code to GitHub for collaboration</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a new repo on GitHub.com, say <code>ice-cream-soda</code>. If curl is your thing, you can also type this on the command line -  </li>
</ol>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ curl -u 'YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME"}'
</code></pre>

<p>When you use <code>ask new</code> to create a new skill using one of the templates (say hello world), the git remote for the skill directory that's created for you points to <code>https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world.git</code>. If you’d like to push your skill code on GitHub, you need to remove the <code>.git</code> directory, which removes the remote. Let’s do that now. </p>
<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Remove the <code>.git</code> directory (hidden by default) to reset the remote origin, which is by default set to <a href="#">https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world.git</a>(https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-hello-world.git). <br />
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ rm -r .git
</code></pre>

<p>You may get a warning asking if you’d like to override removal of <code>.pack</code> and <code>.idx</code> files. Type<code>yes</code> to confirm.</p>
<p>You can now deploy your skill code to a GitHub repo with no problems, without breaking the <code>ask deploy</code> process to deploy the skill to AWS Lambda/Developer Console. </p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Initialize Git
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ git init
</code></pre>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/adding-a-remote">Add a remote</a>to point to the new GitHub repo<br />
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME.git

// example: 
// git remote add origin git@github.com:ajot/ice-cream-soda.git
</code></pre>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    Push to GitHub<br />
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

<h2>Option 2: Using Alexa Hosted as the backend</h2>
<p>You can also use the Alexa Skills Kit CLI to create a skill using Alexa Hosted as the backend, instead of AWS Lambda using the <a href="#">create-hosted-skill</a>(https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-command-reference.html#create-hosted-skill-command) command. Support is available for Node.js only for Alexa Hosted through the CLI. </p>
<h3>Step 1: Create a new skill using the ASK-CLI with AWS Lambda as backend</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open up the terminal, and type the following -  </li>
</ol>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ ask create-hosted-skill
</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Type in your skill name: <code>kiwi-cream-soda</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the runtime - <code>Node.js V8</code> or <code>Python3</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Alexa hosted skill is created. Do you want to clone the skill project to current working directory? (Y/n)
  </li>
  <li>
    Type <code>yes</code><br />
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Your skill has now been automatically <strong>deployed</strong> on the Alexa Developer Console using Alexa Hosted. For future deployments, just use <code>ask deploy</code> from within the skill directory. </p>
<h3>Step 2: Pushing the repo to GitHub</h3>
<p>When you use <code>ask create-hosted-skill</code> to create a new skill, the git remote is set to an AWS Code Commit service <code>https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code>. We need to add another remote, so we can push to both GitHub without breaking the AWS Code Commit service. We will do this in step by adding a new remote (Step 2 below), and then updating the Push URLs for the remotes (Step 3 below)</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new repo on GitHub.com, say <code>kiwi-cream-soda</code>. If curl is your thing, you can also type on the command line -  </li>
</ol>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ curl -u 'YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"YOUR_NEW_REPO_NAME"}'
</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Type the following into the terminal - <br />
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ cd kiwi-cream-soda
$ nano .git/config
</code></pre>

<p>Make a note of the Push URL. We will need this in the next step. This will be something like -<code>https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.....</code></p>
<p>CTRL + X to exit the nano editor.</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/adding-a-remote">Add a new remote</a> <br />
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ git remote add github git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME.git

// example:
// git remote add github git@github.com:ajot/kiwi-cream-soda.git
</code></pre>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Configure the Push URLs - for GitHub, and the original push URL for deploying the skill code to Alexa Hosted. <br />
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Set remote URL for GitHub</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ git remote set-url --add --push origin git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_NAME

//example: 
// git remote set-url --add --push origin git@github.com:ajot/kiwi-cream-soda.git
</code></pre>

<p>Set remote URL for AWS Commit Service to enable the <code>ask deploy</code> workflow.</p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ git remote set-url --add --push origin YOUR_PUSH_URL_FROM_GIT_CONFIG_FILE_FROM_STEP_2

//example:
// git remote set-url --add --push origin https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx

</code></pre>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    Verify the Push URL’s have been updated for the remote origin
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[remote "origin"]
        url = https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
        pushurl = git@github.com:&lt;YOUR_USER_NAME>/kiwi-cream-soda.git
        pushurl = https://git-codecommit.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx

</code></pre>

<p>CTRL + X to exit the nano editor.</p>
<ol start="6">
  <li>
    Deploy to Alexa Hosted, and push to GitHub<br />
  </li>
</ol>

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ ask deploy

</code></pre>

<p>This will deploy the skill to Alexa Hosted, and also push to GitHub. </p>

        <p><p>Been using <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a> on Mac for a while now for creating calendar appointments. While I've been using it to good effect to create calendar appointments, I wanted to see if I could use it as effectively for creating reminders as well. The idea is to get in and out of the verbose Fantastical UI as quickly as possible. Using the mouse to switch between the calendar/reminder mode was a downer for me in that respect. </p> </p>
<p>Turns out Fantastical has a <a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical/faq">solution</a> to this already. Just add /r to switch to reminder or /w for work, /h for home calendar etc. Pretty nifty. Way faster than the mouse.</p><p>

<p>If I think about it, what I am and able to do today, I owe it wholly to that decision I made back in 2009. It was a scary decision. I had set myself on a journey to build something. We (<a href="http://twitter.com/duak">Kunal</a> and I) built <a href="http://rootein.com">Rootein</a>. It didn't work out the way we would have wanted it to, but it was an amazing experience. All we really wanted to do was build and launch something. Perhaps that's where we went wrong. We had no idea what we wanted the future to be with Rootein. We were just too excited to launch it and let people play around with it.</p>
<p>If I hadn't left ESG back then, I would've never visited New York as often as I did. I wouldnt have fallen in love with the city. I would've never made the decision to move here. I would've never been to Startup Weekend in DC in 2010. I would've never met <a href="http://twitter.com/johndbritton">John Britton</a>. I wouldn't have been at <a href="http://mashery.com">Mashery</a>. I would've never had the privelege to rub shoulders with my mentors <a href="http://twitter.com/delynator">Delyn</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mansillaDEV">Neil</a> back in 2011. I would've never had the professional grooming had I not been a Developer Evangelist. I wouldn't have met so many amazing people I;ve had the privilege to meet. I wouldn've have been the same person. </p>
<p>I really owe it to that guy back in 2009. Thank you Amit, Circa 2009.</p><p>

  This post was originally written by me back in 2010 and posted on <a href="http://rootein.com">Rootein</a>'s blog. Sadly, the blog had to be brought down, thanks to some ambitious Russian hackers and poor house keeping on my part!
</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">
  I had then recently quit my job to create <a href="http://rootein.com">Rootein</a> along with <a href="http://twitter.com/duak">@duak</a>. I remember I was scared, unsure of the future. I hated what I was doing then and quitting the job just felt right at the time. Looking back, was it the right decision? Absolutely. In fact, I regard that as the single best decision I've ever made.
</p>

<hr />
<p>We were just about getting ready to warm up for the practice game over the weekend when I had an interesting conversation with one of the team mates I actually didn't know quite well.</p> </p>
<p>"So what do you do?" he asked. "Well, we work for ourselves, we run a software company", I replied. "Oh really! that's awesome! I work for xyz company, but you know I always wanted to get into animation design and work for myself. It was my dream. I got stuck in the wrong industry"</p>
<p>"You ain't dead yet, are you?" I thought, trying hard not say that aloud. He continued, "You know, I've been wanting to do this for 10 years now, but once you have a family, it's very tough to do anything else"</p>
<p>I couldn't resist anymore, so I said "That's great. If you really want to do that, may be you should take up some animation classes, or do some self learning at your own pace. That would be a good start." Pat came the reply "Nahh it's very difficult, with family, full time job, no time. I would love to, but I can't."</p>
<p>Reluctantly, I suggested - "Then may be you should consider training full time for a few weeks/months and perhaps dive in full-time?" He looked at me like I had just asked him to cut off his right hand - "Are you crazy? Where will the paycheck come from?"</p>
<p>Realizing this conversation was heading towards an argument with someone I didn't know very well at the first place, I chose to just smile and leave it at that. But it made me think. What is it with people refusing to take some risks to follow their dreams. Are their dreams not worth it? If not, why do we sulk about them later? Don't we owe it to ourselves to at least give our dreams a fair shot?</p>
<p>Now, I understand, diving in full time isn't always an option for everybody, but that shouldn't deter us from at least starting to move in the right direction. Take baby steps I say if you can't afford drastic measures, but for God's sake don't kill your dreams.</p>
<p>We all had some crazy ideas and dreams when we were kids. When people asked - "What do you want to do when you grow up?" you didn't say "I want to play safe and be an executive for a fortune 100 company" or "I want to work for the government for the job security"? You wanted to do something that excited you, that you were passionate about - "Armed forces, scientist, sports, music, dance, miss world" etc. You didn't even think if that would get you enough money. You just wanted to do it.</p>
<p>So why is it that as we grow up we lose all the passion, the energy, the will, and the strength to keep our dreams alive. Why does money dictate our passion or in most cases, kill it? Why do we let "safety of a paycheck" screw our dreams? Why do we stop thinking about what we love?</p>
<p>We are so seduced by the thought of a guaranteed paycheck every month that we completely ignore the fact that it's actually never too late to pursue our dreams. The reason, as I can understand is probably "fear of failure". We fear we might fail and that fear leads us to cook up stories about why we can't have what we want. Alibis like "I don't have time. I have family. I'll do it when I have more money etc." Stories that convince us that it's ok not to follow up on our dreams, that it's ok not to do what we love, that it's ok to just keep doing the everyday drill.</p>
<p>Like Tony Robbins put it - "The only thing that's keeping you from getting what you want is the story you keep telling yourself about why you can't have it."</p>
<p>What are we waiting for? A perfect day when all stars would line up in just the right direction and you would be guaranteed success? It never works that way. That moment of glory never arrives. All circumstances will almost never be in your favor. There will always be something that would be challenging. You just have to bite the bullet and take the plunge. When we set out to create Rootein, we didn't wait for everything to be just perfect, much as we would have liked. We just dived in. We started developing rootein while we were working full-time. We loved what we were doing and we did it while keeping our day time jobs. It wasn't easy, but it was fun because we were chasing our dream of working for ourselves, building software that we were passionate about.</p>
<p>May be it's just us. May be we are weird. May be we are foolish, but we would rather be foolish and strive to live our dream than come up with some alibis. True success is not money driven, it's driven by love and passion. You've got to love what you are doing and you've got to be passionate about it.</p>
<p>Failing is not scary. What's scary is that you are 60 and reflecting back on your life "May be I should've given my dreams a chance, may be I would've succeeded, may be I would've lived my dream" But now it's too late. You might have missed the boat.</p>
<p>Don't be scared to follow your dreams. That's the worst thing you can do to yourself.</p>
<p>Rocky sing!</p>
<p>"So many times, it happens too fast<br />
You change your passion for glory<br />
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br />
You must fight just to keep them alive"</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">
  <strong>Update:</strong> As it turned out, quitting my job was one of the biggest turning points in my life. It's rightly said that we learn more from our failures than our successes, and boy, was driving Rootein a humbling yet insightful experience.

<p style="font-style:italic;">
  So, am I following my dream? I have since moved on to be a <a href="https://www.ajot.me/being-a-developer-evangelist">Developer Evangelist</a> at <a href="http://dev.mashery.com">Mashery</a>. I absolutely love what I do. I love the people I work with. I don't hate Mondays. I don't wait for Fridays to happen. I meet and work with some incredibly bright and passionate people everyday. If that's not a dream, I don't know what is.
